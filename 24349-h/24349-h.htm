      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      The young men of our American Relief Corps are beginning to come back from
      the front with stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no time to pick them up during the first months&mdash;the whole
      business was too wild and grim. The horror has not decreased, but nerves
      and sight are beginning to be disciplined to it. In the earlier days,
      moreover, such fragments of experience as one got were torn from their
      setting like bits of flesh scattered by shrapnel. Now things that seemed
      disjointed are beginning to link themselves together, and the broken bones
      of history are rising from the battle-fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can&rsquo;t say that, in this respect, all the members of the Relief Corps
      have made the most of their opportunity. Some are unobservant, or perhaps
      simply inarticulate; others, when going beyond the bald statistics of
      their job, tend to drop into sentiment and cinema scenes; and none but H.
      Macy Greer has the gift of making the thing told seem as true as if one
      had seen it. So it is on H. Macy Greer that I depend, and when his motor
      dashes him back to Paris for supplies I never fail to hunt him down and
      coax him to my rooms for dinner and a long cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Greer is a small hard-muscled youth, with pleasant manners, a sallow face,
      straight hemp-coloured hair and grey eyes of unexpected inwardness. He has
      a voice like thick soup, and speaks with the slovenly drawl of the new
      generation of Americans, dragging his words along like reluctant dogs on a
      string, and depriving his narrative of every shade of expression that
      intelligent intonation gives. But his eyes see so much that they make one
      see even what his foggy voice obscures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of his tales are dark and dreadful, some are unutterably sad, and
      some end in a huge laugh of irony. I am not sure how I ought to classify
      the one I have written down here.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      ON my first dash to the Northern fighting line&mdash;Greer told me the
      other night&mdash;I carried supplies to an ambulance where the surgeon
      asked me to have a talk with an officer who was badly wounded and fretting
      for news of his people in the east of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a young Frenchman, a cavalry lieutenant, trim and slim, with a
      pleasant smile and obstinate blue eyes that I liked. He looked as if he
      could hold on tight when it was worth his while. He had had a leg smashed,
      poor devil, in the first fighting in Flanders, and had been dragging on
      for weeks in the squalid camp-hospital where I found him. He didn&rsquo;t waste
      any words on himself, but began at once about his family. They were
      living, when the war broke out, at their country-place in the Vosges; his
      father and mother, his sister, just eighteen, and his brother Alain, two
      years younger. His father, the Comte de Réchamp, had married late in life,
      and was over seventy: his mother, a good deal younger, was crippled with
      rheumatism; and there was, besides&mdash;to round off the group&mdash;a
      helpless but intensely alive and domineering old grandmother about whom
      all the others revolved. You know how French families hang together, and
      throw out branches that make new roots but keep hold of the central trunk,
      like that tree&mdash;what&rsquo;s it called?&mdash;that they give pictures of in
      books about the East.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean de Réchamp&mdash;that was my lieutenant&rsquo;s name&mdash;told me his
      family was a typical case. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very <i>province</i>,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My
      people live at Réchamp all the year. We have a house at Nancy&mdash;rather
      a fine old hôtel&mdash;but my parents go there only once in two or three
      years, for a few weeks. That&rsquo;s our &lsquo;season.&rsquo;...Imagine the point of view!
      Or rather don&rsquo;t, because you couldn&rsquo;t....&rdquo; (He had been about the world a
      good deal, and known something of other angles of vision.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, of this helpless exposed little knot of people he had had no word&mdash;simply
      nothing&mdash;since the first of August. He was at home, staying with them
      at Réchamp, when war broke out. He was mobilised the first day, and had
      only time to throw his traps into a cart and dash to the station. His
      depot was on the other side of France, and communications with the East by
      mail and telegraph were completely interrupted during the first weeks. His
      regiment was sent at once to the fighting line, and the first news he got
      came to him in October, from a communiqué in a Paris paper a month old,
      saying: &ldquo;The enemy yesterday retook Réchamp.&rdquo; After that, dead silence:
      and the poor devil left in the trenches to digest that &ldquo;<i>retook</i>&rdquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      There are thousands and thousands of just such cases; and men bearing
      them, and cracking jokes, and hitting out as hard as they can. Jean de
      Réchamp knew this, and tried to crack jokes too&mdash;but he got his leg
      smashed just afterward, and ever since he&rsquo;d been lying on a straw pallet
      under a horse-blanket, saying to himself: &ldquo;<i>Réchamp retaken</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he explained with a weary smile, &ldquo;as long as you can tot up
      your daily bag in the trenches it&rsquo;s a sort of satisfaction&mdash;though I
      don&rsquo;t quite know why; anyhow, you&rsquo;re so dead-beat at night that no dreams
      come. But lying here staring at the ceiling one goes through the whole
      business once an hour, at the least: the attack, the slaughter, the
      ruins...and worse.... Haven&rsquo;t I seen and heard things enough on <i>this</i>
      side to know what&rsquo;s been happening on the other? Don&rsquo;t try to sugar the
      dose. I <i>like</i> it bitter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was three days in the neighbourhood, and I went back every day to see
      him. He liked to talk to me because he had a faint hope of my getting news
      of his family when I returned to Paris. I hadn&rsquo;t much myself, but there
      was no use telling him so. Besides, things change from day to day, and
      when we parted I promised to get word to him as soon as I could find out
      anything. We both knew, of course, that that would not be till Réchamp was
      taken a third time&mdash;by his own troops; and perhaps soon after that, I
      should be able to get there, or near there, and make enquiries myself. To
      make sure that I should forget nothing, he drew the family photographs
      from under his pillow, and handed them over: the little witch-grandmother,
      with a face like a withered walnut, the father, a fine broken-looking old
      boy with a Roman nose and a weak chin, the mother, in crape, simple,
      serious and provincial, the little sister ditto, and Alain, the young
      brother&mdash;just the age the brutes have been carrying off to German
      prisons&mdash;an over-grown thread-paper boy with too much forehead and
      eyes, and not a muscle in his body. A charming-looking family,
      distinguished and amiable; but all, except the grandmother, rather usual.
      The kind of people who come in sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I pocketed the photographs I noticed that another lay face down by his
      pillow. &ldquo;Is that for me too?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He coloured and shook his head, and I felt I had blundered. But after a
      moment he turned the photograph over and held it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the young girl I am engaged to. She was at Réchamp visiting my
      parents when war was declared; but she was to leave the day after I
      did....&rdquo; He hesitated. &ldquo;There may have been some difficulty about her
      going.... I should like to be sure she got away.... Her name is Yvonne
      Malo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not offer me the photograph, and I did not need it. That girl had a
      face of her own! Dark and keen and splendid: a type so different from the
      others that I found myself staring. If he had not said &ldquo;<i>ma fiancée</i>&rdquo;
       I should have understood better. After another pause he went on: &ldquo;I will
      give you her address in Paris. She has no family: she lives alone&mdash;she
      is a musician. Perhaps you may find her there.&rdquo; His colour deepened again
      as he added: &ldquo;But I know nothing&mdash;I have had no news of her either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To ease the silence that followed I suggested: &ldquo;But if she has no family,
      wouldn&rsquo;t she have been likely to stay with your people, and wouldn&rsquo;t that
      be the reason of your not hearing from her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think she stayed.&rdquo; He seemed about to add: &ldquo;If she
      could help it,&rdquo; but shut his lips and slid the picture out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I got back to Paris I made enquiries, but without result. The
      Germans had been pushed back from that particular spot after a fortnight&rsquo;s
      intermittent occupation; but their lines were close by, across the valley,
      and Réchamp was still in a net of trenches. No one could get to it, and
      apparently no news could come from it. For the moment, at any rate, I
      found it impossible to get in touch with the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      My enquiries about Mlle. Malo were equally unfruitful. I went to the
      address Réchamp had given me, somewhere off in Passy, among gardens, in
      what they call a &ldquo;Square,&rdquo; no doubt because it&rsquo;s oblong: a kind of long
      narrow court with aesthetic-looking studio buildings round it. Mlle. Malo
      lived in one of them, on the top floor, the concierge said, and I looked
      up and saw a big studio window, and a roof-terrace with dead gourds
      dangling from a pergola. But she wasn&rsquo;t there, she hadn&rsquo;t been there, and
      they had no news of her. I wrote to Réchamp of my double failure, he sent
      me back a line of thanks; and after that for a long while I heard no more
      of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the beginning of November the enemy&rsquo;s hold had begun to loosen in the
      Argonne and along the Vosges, and one day we were sent off to the East
      with a couple of ambulances. Of course we had to have military chauffeurs,
      and the one attached to my ambulance happened to be a fellow I knew. The
      day before we started, in talking over our route with him, I said: &ldquo;I
      suppose we can manage to get to Réchamp now?&rdquo; He looked puzzled&mdash;it
      was such a little place that he&rsquo;d forgotten the name. &ldquo;Why do you want to
      get there?&rdquo; he wondered. I told him, and he gave an exclamation. &ldquo;Good
      God! Of course&mdash;but how extraordinary! Jean de Réchamp&rsquo;s here now, in
      Paris, too lame for the front, and driving a motor.&rdquo; We stared at each
      other, and he went on: &ldquo;He must take my place&mdash;he must go with you. I
      don&rsquo;t know how it can be done; but done it shall be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Done it was, and the next morning at daylight I found Jean de Réchamp at
      the wheel of my car. He looked another fellow from the wreck I had left in
      the Flemish hospital; all made over, and burning with activity, but older,
      and with lines about his eyes. He had had news from his people in the
      interval, and had learned that they were still at Réchamp, and well. What
      was more surprising was that Mlle. Malo was with them&mdash;had never
      left. Alain had been got away to England, where he remained; but none of
      the others had budged. They had fitted up an ambulance in the château, and
      Mlle. Malo and the little sister were nursing the wounded. There were not
      many details in the letters, and they had been a long time on the way; but
      their tone was so reassuring that Jean could give himself up to unclouded
      anticipation. You may fancy if he was grateful for the chance I was giving
      him; for of course he couldn&rsquo;t have seen his people in any other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our permits, as you know, don&rsquo;t as a rule let us into the firing-line: we
      only take supplies to second-line ambulances, and carry back the badly
      wounded in need of delicate operations. So I wasn&rsquo;t in the least sure we
      should be allowed to go to Réchamp&mdash;though I had made up my mind to
      get there, anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were about a fortnight on the way, coming and going in Champagne and
      the Argonne, and that gave us time to get to know each other. It was
      bitter cold, and after our long runs over the lonely frozen hills we used
      to crawl into the café of the inn&mdash;if there was one&mdash;and talk
      and talk. We put up in fairly rough places, generally in a farm house or a
      cottage packed with soldiers; for the villages have all remained empty
      since the autumn, except when troops are quartered in them. Usually, to
      keep warm, we had to go up after supper to the room we shared, and get
      under the blankets with our clothes on. Once some jolly Sisters of Charity
      took us in at their Hospice, and we slept two nights in an ice-cold
      whitewashed cell&mdash;but what tales we heard around their kitchen-fire!
      The Sisters had stayed alone to face the Germans, had seen the town burn,
      and had made the Teutons turn the hose on the singed roof of their Hospice
      and beat the fire back from it. It&rsquo;s a pity those Sisters of Charity can&rsquo;t
      marry....
    </p>
    <p>
      Réchamp told me a lot in those days. I don&rsquo;t believe he was talkative
      before the war, but his long weeks in hospital, starving for news, had
      unstrung him. And then he was mad with excitement at getting back to his
      own place. In the interval he&rsquo;d heard how other people caught in their
      country-houses had fared&mdash;you know the stories we all refused to
      believe at first, and that we now prefer not to think about.... Well, he&rsquo;d
      been thinking about those stories pretty steadily for some months; and he
      kept repeating: &ldquo;My people say they&rsquo;re all right&mdash;but they give no
      details.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;there never were such helpless beings. Even if
      there had been time to leave, they couldn&rsquo;t have done it. My mother had
      been having one of her worst attacks of rheumatism&mdash;she was in bed,
      helpless, when I left. And my grandmother, who is a demon of activity in
      the house, won&rsquo;t stir out of it. We haven&rsquo;t been able to coax her into the
      garden for years. She says it&rsquo;s draughty; and you know how we all feel
      about draughts! As for my father, he hasn&rsquo;t had to decide anything since
      the Comte de Chambord refused to adopt the tricolour. My father decided
      that he was right, and since then there has been nothing particular for
      him to take a stand about. But I know how he behaved just as well as if
      I&rsquo;d been there&mdash;he kept saying: &lsquo;One must act&mdash;one must act!&rsquo; 
      and sitting in his chair and doing nothing. Oh, I&rsquo;m not disrespectful:
      they were <i>like</i> that in his generation! Besides&mdash;it&rsquo;s better to
      laugh at things, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; And suddenly his face would darken....
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, however, his spirits were good till we began to traverse the
      line of ruined towns between Sainte Menehould and Bar-le-Duc. &ldquo;This is the
      way the devils came,&rdquo; he kept saying to me; and I saw he was hard at work
      picturing the work they must have done in his own neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But since your sister writes that your people are safe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They may have made her write that to reassure me. They&rsquo;d heard I was
      badly wounded. And, mind you, there&rsquo;s never been a line from my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you say your mother&rsquo;s hands are so lame that she can&rsquo;t hold a pen.
      And wouldn&rsquo;t Mlle. Malo have written you the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that his frown would lift. &ldquo;Oh, yes. She would despise any attempt at
      concealment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;what the deuce is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s when I see these devils&rsquo; traces&mdash;&rdquo; he could only mutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when we had passed through a particularly devastated little
      place, and had got from the curé some more than usually abominable details
      of things done there, Réchamp broke out to me over the kitchen-fire of our
      night&rsquo;s lodging. &ldquo;When I hear things like that I don&rsquo;t believe anybody who
      tells me my people are all right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know well enough,&rdquo; I insisted, &ldquo;that the Germans are not all
      alike&mdash;that it all depends on the particular officer....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know,&rdquo; he assented, with a visible effort at impartiality.
      &ldquo;Only, you see&mdash;as one gets nearer....&rdquo; He went on to say that, when
      he had been sent from the ambulance at the front to a hospital at Moulins,
      he had been for a day or two in a ward next to some wounded German
      soldiers&mdash;bad cases, they were&mdash;and had heard them talking. They
      didn&rsquo;t know he knew German, and he had heard things.... There was one name
      always coming back in their talk, von Scharlach, Oberst von Scharlach. One
      of them, a young fellow, said: &ldquo;I wish now I&rsquo;d cut my hand off rather than
      do what he told us to that night.... Every time the fever comes I see it
      all again. I wish I&rsquo;d been struck dead first.&rdquo; They all said &ldquo;Scharlach&rdquo;
       with a kind of terror in their voices, as if he might hear them even
      there, and come down on them horribly. Réchamp had asked where their
      regiment came from, and had been told: From the Vosges. That had set his
      brain working, and whenever he saw a ruined village, or heard a tale of
      savagery, the Scharlach nerve began to quiver. At such times it was no use
      reminding him that the Germans had had at least three hundred thousand men
      in the East in August. He simply didn&rsquo;t listen....

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day before we started for Réchamp his spirits flew up again, and that
      night he became confidential. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been such a friend to me that there
      are certain things&mdash;seeing what&rsquo;s ahead of us&mdash;that I should
      like to explain&rdquo;; and, noticing my surprise, he went on: &ldquo;I mean about my
      people. The state of mind in my <i>milieu</i> must be so remote from
      anything you&rsquo;re used to in your happy country.... But perhaps I can make
      you understand....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw that what he wanted was to talk to me of the girl he was engaged to.
      Mlle. Malo, left an orphan at ten, had been the ward of a neighbour of the
      Réchamps&rsquo;, a chap with an old name and a starred château, who had lost
      almost everything else at baccarat before he was forty, and had repented,
      had the gout and studied agriculture for the rest of his life. The girl&rsquo;s
      father was a rather brilliant painter, who died young, and her mother, who
      followed him in a year or two, was a Pole: you may fancy that, with such
      antecedents, the girl was just the mixture to shake down quietly into
      French country life with a gouty and repentant guardian. The Marquis de
      Corvenaire&mdash;that was his name&mdash;brought her down to his place,
      got an old maid sister to come and stay, and really, as far as one knows,
      brought his ward up rather decently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then she used to be driven over to play with the young Réchamps,
      and Jean remembered her as an ugly little girl in a plaid frock, who used
      to invent wonderful games and get tired of playing them just as the other
      children were beginning to learn how. But her domineering ways and
      searching questions did not meet with his mother&rsquo;s approval, and her
      visits were not encouraged. When she was seventeen her guardian died and
      left her a little money. The maiden sister had gone dotty, there was
      nobody to look after Yvonne, and she went to Paris, to an aunt, broke
      loose from the aunt when she came of age, set up her studio, travelled,
      painted, played the violin, knew lots of people; and never laid eyes on
      Jean de Réchamp till about a year before the war, when her guardian&rsquo;s
      place was sold, and she had to go down there to see about her interest in
      the property.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Réchamps heard she was coming, but didn&rsquo;t ask her to stay. Jean
      drove over to the shut-up chateau, however, and found Mlle. Malo lunching
      on a corner of the kitchen table. She exclaimed: &ldquo;My little Jean!&rdquo; flew to
      him with a kiss for each cheek, and made him sit down and share her
      omelet.... The ugly little girl had shed her chrysalis&mdash;and you may
      fancy if he went back once or twice!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mlle. Malo was staying at the chateau all alone, with the farmer&rsquo;s wife to
      come in and cook her dinner: not a soul in the house at night but herself
      and her brindled sheep dog. She had to be there a week, and Jean suggested
      to his people to ask her to Réchamp. But at Réchamp they hesitated,
      coughed, looked away, said the sparerooms were all upside down, and the
      valet-de-chambre laid up with the mumps, and the cook short-handed&mdash;till
      finally the irrepressible grandmother broke out: &ldquo;A young girl who chooses
      to live alone&mdash;probably prefers to live alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a deadly silence, and Jean did not raise the question again; but
      I can imagine his blue eyes getting obstinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after Mlle. Malo&rsquo;s return to Paris he followed her and began to
      frequent the Passy studio. The life there was unlike anything he had ever
      seen&mdash;or conceived as possible, short of the prairies. He had sampled
      the usual varieties of French womankind, and explored most of the social
      layers; but he had missed the newest, that of the artistic-emancipated. I
      don&rsquo;t know much about that set myself, but from his descriptions I should
      say they were a good deal like intelligent Americans, except that they
      don&rsquo;t seem to keep art and life in such water-tight compartments. But his
      great discovery was the new girl. Apparently he had never before known any
      but the traditional type, which predominates in the provinces, and still
      persists, he tells me, in the last fastnesses of the Faubourg St. Germain.
      The girl who comes and goes as she pleases, reads what she likes, has
      opinions about what she reads, who talks, looks, behaves with the
      independence of a married woman&mdash;and yet has kept the Diana-freshness&mdash;think
      how she must have shaken up such a man&rsquo;s inherited view of things! Mlle.
      Malo did far more than make Réchamp fall in love with her: she turned his
      world topsy-turvey, and prevented his ever again squeezing himself into
      his little old pigeon-hole of prejudices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long they confessed their love&mdash;just like any young couple of
      Anglo-Saxons&mdash;and Jean went down to Réchamp to ask permission to
      marry her. Neither you nor I can quite enter into the state of mind of a
      young man of twenty-seven who has knocked about all over the globe, and
      been in and out of the usual sentimental coils&mdash;and who has to ask
      his parents&rsquo; leave to get married! Don&rsquo;t let us try: it&rsquo;s no use. We
      should only end by picturing him as an incorrigible ninny. But there isn&rsquo;t
      a man in France who wouldn&rsquo;t feel it his duty to take that step, as Jean
      de Réchamp did. All we can do is to accept the premise and pass on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well&mdash;Jean went down and asked his father and his mother and his old
      grandmother if they would permit him to marry Mlle. Malo; and they all
      with one voice said they wouldn&rsquo;t. There was an uproar, in fact; and the
      old grandmother contributed the most piercing note to the concert. Marry
      Mlle. Malo! A young girl who lived alone! Travelled! Spent her time with
      foreigners&mdash;with musicians and painters! <i>A young girl!</i> Of
      course, if she had been a married woman&mdash;that is, a widow&mdash;much
      as they would have preferred a young girl for Jean, or even, if widow it
      had to be, a widow of another type&mdash;still, it was conceivable that,
      out of affection for him, they might have resigned themselves to his
      choice. But a young girl&mdash;bring such a young girl to Réchamp! Ask
      them to receive her under the same roof with their little Simone, their
      innocent Alain....
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a bad hour of it; but he held his own, keeping silent while they
      screamed, and stiffening as they began to wobble from exhaustion. Finally
      he took his mother apart, and tried to reason with her. His arguments were
      not much use, but his resolution impressed her, and he saw it. As for his
      father, nobody was afraid of Monsieur de Réchamp. When he said: &ldquo;Never&mdash;never
      while I live, and there is a roof on Réchamp!&rdquo; they all knew he had
      collapsed inside. But the grandmother was terrible. She was terrible
      because she was so old, and so clever at taking advantage of it. She could
      bring on a valvular heart attack by just sitting still and holding her
      breath, as Jean and his mother had long since found out; and she always
      treated them to one when things weren&rsquo;t going as she liked. Madame de
      Réchamp promised Jean that she would intercede with her mother-in-law; but
      she hadn&rsquo;t much faith in the result, and when she came out of the old
      lady&rsquo;s room she whispered: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just sitting there holding her breath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day Jean himself advanced to the attack. His grandmother was the
      most intelligent member of the family, and she knew he knew it, and liked
      him for having found it out; so when he had her alone she listened to him
      without resorting to any valvular tricks. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he explained,
      &ldquo;you&rsquo;re much too clever not to understand that the times have changed, and
      manners with them, and that what a woman was criticised for doing
      yesterday she is ridiculed for not doing to-day. Nearly all the old social
      thou-shalt-nots have gone: intelligent people nowadays don&rsquo;t give a fig
      for them, and that simple fact has abolished them. They only existed as
      long as there was some one left for them to scare.&rdquo; His grandmother
      listened with a sparkle of admiration in her ancient eyes. &ldquo;And of
      course,&rdquo; Jean pursued, &ldquo;that can&rsquo;t be the real reason for your opposing my
      marriage&mdash;a marriage with a young girl you&rsquo;ve always known, who has
      been received here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s it&mdash;we&rsquo;ve always known her!&rdquo; the old lady snapped him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of that? I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re here so little: you don&rsquo;t hear things....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things in the air... that blow about.... You were doing your military
      service at the time....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned forward and laid a warning hand on his arm. &ldquo;Why did Corvenaire
      leave her all that money&mdash;<i>why?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why not&mdash;why shouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Jean stammered, indignant. Then she
      unpacked her bag&mdash;a heap of vague insinuations, baseless conjectures,
      village tattle, all, at the last analysis, based, as he succeeded in
      proving, and making her own, on a word launched at random by a discharged
      maid-servant who had retailed her grievance to the cure&rsquo;s housekeeper.
      &ldquo;Oh, she does what she likes with Monsieur le Marquis, the young miss! <i>She</i>
      knows how....&rdquo; On that single phrase the neighbourhood had raised a
      slander built of adamant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I&rsquo;ll give you an idea of what a determined fellow Réchamp is, when I
      tell you he pulled it down&mdash;or thought he did. He kept his temper,
      hunted up the servant&rsquo;s record, proved her a liar and dishonest, cast
      grave doubts on the discretion of the cure&rsquo;s housekeeper, and poured such
      a flood of ridicule over the whole flimsy fable, and those who had
      believed in it, that in sheer shamefacedness at having based her objection
      on such grounds, his grandmother gave way, and brought his parents
      toppling down with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this happened a few weeks before the war, and soon afterward Mlle.
      Malo came down to Réchamp. Jean had insisted on her coming: he wanted her
      presence there, as his betrothed, to be known to the neighbourhood. As for
      her, she seemed delighted to come. I could see from Rechamp&rsquo;s tone, when
      he reached this part of his story, that he rather thought I should expect
      its heroine to have shown a becoming reluctance&mdash;to have stood on her
      dignity. He was distinctly relieved when he found I expected no such
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s simplicity itself&mdash;it&rsquo;s her great quality. Vain complications
      don&rsquo;t exist for her, because she doesn&rsquo;t see them... that&rsquo;s what my people
      can&rsquo;t be made to understand....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gathered from the last phrase that the visit had not been a complete
      success, and this explained his having let out, when he first told me of
      his fears for his family, that he was sure Mlle. Malo would not have
      remained at Réchamp if she could help it. Oh, no, decidedly, the visit was
      not a success....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he explained with a half-embarrassed smile, &ldquo;it was partly her
      fault. Other girls as clever, but less&mdash;how shall I say?&mdash;less
      proud, would have adapted themselves, arranged things, avoided startling
      allusions. She wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to that; she talked to my family as
      naturally as she did to me. You can imagine for instance, the effect of
      her saying: &lsquo;One night, after a supper at Montmartre, I was walking home
      with two or three pals&rsquo;&mdash;. It was her way of affirming her
      convictions, and I adored her for it&mdash;but I wished she wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he depicted, to my joy, the neighbours rumbling over to call in
      heraldic barouches (the mothers alone&mdash;with embarrassed excuses for
      not bringing their daughters), and the agony of not knowing, till they
      were in the room, if Yvonne would receive them with lowered lids and
      folded hands, sitting by in a <i>pose de fiancée</i> while the elders
      talked; or if she would take the opportunity to air her views on the
      separation of Church and State, or the necessity of making divorce easier.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;that she really takes much interest in such
      questions: she&rsquo;s much more absorbed in her music and painting. But
      anything her eye lights on sets her mind dancing&mdash;as she said to me
      once: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s your mother&rsquo;s friends&rsquo; bonnets that make me stand up for
      divorce!&rsquo;&rdquo; He broke off abruptly to add: &ldquo;Good God, how far off all that
      nonsense seems!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day we started for Réchamp, not sure if we could get through, but
      bound to, anyhow! It was the coldest day we&rsquo;d had, the sky steel, the
      earth iron, and a snow-wind howling down on us from the north. The Vosges
      are splendid in winter. In summer they are just plump puddingy hills; when
      the wind strips them they turn to mountains. And we seemed to have the
      whole country to ourselves&mdash;the black firs, the blue shadows, the
      beech-woods cracking and groaning like rigging, the bursts of snowy
      sunlight from cold clouds. Not a soul in sight except the sentinels
      guarding the railways, muffled to the eyes, or peering out of their huts
      of pine-boughs at the cross-roads. Every now and then we passed a long
      string of seventy-fives, or a train of supply waggons or army ambulances,
      and at intervals a cavalryman cantered by, his cloak bellied out by the
      gale; but of ordinary people about the common jobs of life, not a sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sense of loneliness and remoteness that the absence of the civil
      population produces everywhere in eastern France is increased by the fact
      that all the names and distances on the mile-stones have been scratched
      out and the sign-posts at the cross-roads thrown down. It was done,
      presumably, to throw the enemy off the track in September: and the signs
      have never been put back. The result is that one is forever losing one&rsquo;s
      way, for the soldiers quartered in the district know only the names of
      their particular villages, and those on the march can tell you nothing
      about the places they are passing through. We had got badly off our road
      several times during the trip, but on the last day&rsquo;s run Réchamp was in
      his own country, and knew every yard of the way&mdash;or thought he did.
      We had turned off the main road, and were running along between rather
      featureless fields and woods, crossed by a good many wood-roads with
      nothing to distinguish them; but he continued to push ahead, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t turn till we get to a manor-house on a stream, with a big
      paper-mill across the road.&rdquo; He went on to tell me that the mill-owners
      lived in the manor, and were old friends of his people: good old local
      stock, who had lived there for generations and done a lot for the
      neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer I don&rsquo;t see their village-steeple from this rise. The village
      is just beyond the house. How the devil could I have missed the turn?&rdquo; We
      ran on a little farther, and suddenly he stopped the motor with a jerk. We
      were at a cross-road, with a stream running under the bank on our right.
      The place looked like an abandoned stoneyard. I never saw completer ruin.
      To the left, a fortified gate gaped on emptiness; to the right, a
      mill-wheel hung in the stream. Everything else was as flat as your
      dinner-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was this what you were trying to see from that rise?&rdquo; I asked; and I saw
      a tear or two running down his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were the kindest people: their only son got himself shot the first
      month in Champagne&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had jumped out of the car and was standing staring at the level waste.
      &ldquo;The house was there&mdash;there was a splendid lime in the court. I used
      to sit under it and have a glass of <i>vin cris de Lorraine</i> with the
      old people.... Over there, where that cinder-heap is, all their children
      are buried.&rdquo; He walked across to the grave-yard under a blackened wall&mdash;a
      bit of the apse of the vanished church&mdash;and sat down on a
      grave-stone. &ldquo;If the devils have done this <i>here</i>&mdash;so close to
      us,&rdquo; he burst out, and covered his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old woman walked toward us down the road. Réchamp jumped up and ran to
      meet her. &ldquo;Why, Marie Jeanne, what are you doing in these ruins?&rdquo; The old
      woman looked at him with unastonished eyes. She seemed incapable of any
      surprise. &ldquo;They left my house standing. I&rsquo;m glad to see Monsieur,&rdquo; she
      simply said. We followed her to the one house left in the waste of stones.
      It was a two-roomed cottage, propped against a cow-stable, but fairly
      decent, with a curtain in the window and a cat on the sill. Réchamp caught
      me by the arm and pointed to the door-panel. &ldquo;Oberst von Scharlach&rdquo; was
      scrawled on it. He turned as white as your table-cloth, and hung on to me
      a minute; then he spoke to the old woman. &ldquo;The officers were quartered
      here: that was the reason they spared your house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;Yes: I was lucky. But the gentlemen must come in and have a
      mouthful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Réchamp&rsquo;s finger was on the name. &ldquo;And this one&mdash;this was their
      commanding officer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. Is it somebody&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; She had evidently never speculated
      on the meaning of the scrawl that had saved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember him&mdash;their captain? Was his name Scharlach?&rdquo; Réchamp
      persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under its rich weathering the old woman&rsquo;s face grew as pale as his. &ldquo;Yes,
      that was his name&mdash;I heard it often enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Describe him, then. What was he like? Tall and fair? They&rsquo;re all that&mdash;but
      what else? What in particular?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, and then said: &ldquo;This one wasn&rsquo;t fair. He was dark, and had
      a scar that drew up the left corner of his mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Réchamp turned to me. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same. I heard the men describing him at
      Moulins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We followed the old woman into the house, and while she gave us some bread
      and wine she told us about the wrecking of the village and the factory. It
      was one of the most damnable stories I&rsquo;ve heard yet. Put together the
      worst of the typical horrors and you&rsquo;ll have a fair idea of it. Murder,
      outrage, torture: Scharlach&rsquo;s programme seemed to be fairly comprehensive.
      She ended off by saying: &ldquo;His orderly showed me a silver-mounted flute he
      always travelled with, and a beautiful paint-box mounted in silver too.
      Before he left he sat down on my door-step and made a painting of the
      ruins....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon after leaving this place of death we got to the second lines and our
      troubles began. We had to do a lot of talking to get through the lines,
      but what Réchamp had just seen had made him eloquent. Luckily, too, the
      ambulance doctor, a charming fellow, was short of tetanus-serum, and I had
      some left; and while I went over with him to the pine-branch hut where he
      hid his wounded I explained Réchamp&rsquo;s case, and implored him to get us
      through. Finally it was settled that we should leave the ambulance there&mdash;for
      in the lines the ban against motors is absolute&mdash;and drive the
      remaining twelve miles. A sergeant fished out of a farmhouse a toothless
      old woman with a furry horse harnessed to a two-wheeled trap, and we
      started off by round-about wood-tracks. The horse was in no hurry, nor the
      old lady either; for there were bits of road that were pretty steadily
      currycombed by shell, and it was to everybody&rsquo;s interest not to cross them
      before twilight. Jean de Réchamp&rsquo;s excitement seemed to have dropped: he
      sat beside me dumb as a fish, staring straight ahead of him. I didn&rsquo;t feel
      talkative either, for a word the doctor had let drop had left me thinking.
      &ldquo;That poor old granny mind the shells? Not she!&rdquo; he had said when our
      crazy chariot drove up. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know them from snow-flakes any more.
      Nothing matters to her now, except trying to outwit a German. They&rsquo;re all
      like that where Scharlach&rsquo;s been&mdash;you&rsquo;ve heard of him? She had only
      one boy&mdash;half-witted: he cocked a broomhandle at them, and they burnt
      him. Oh, she&rsquo;ll take you to Réchamp safe enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where Scharlach&rsquo;s been&rdquo;&mdash;so he had been as close as this to Réchamp!
      I was wondering if Jean knew it, and if that had sealed his lips and given
      him that flinty profile. The old horse&rsquo;s woolly flanks jogged on under the
      bare branches and the old woman&rsquo;s bent back jogged in time with it. She
      never once spoke or looked around at us. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the noise we make
      that&rsquo;ll give us away,&rdquo; I said at last; and just then the old woman turned
      her head and pointed silently with the osier-twig she used as a whip. Just
      ahead of us lay a heap of ruins: the wreck, apparently, of a great château
      and its dependencies. &ldquo;Lermont!&rdquo; Réchamp exclaimed, turning white. He made
      a motion to jump out and then dropped back into the seat. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
      use?&rdquo; he muttered. He leaned forward and touched the old woman&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t heard of this&mdash;when did it happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In September.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>They</i> did it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Our wounded were there. It&rsquo;s like this everywhere in our country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw Jean stiffening himself for the next question. &ldquo;At Réchamp, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She relapsed into indifference. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been as far as Réchamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must have seen people who&rsquo;d been there&mdash;you must have
      heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard the masters were still there&mdash;so there must be something
      standing. Maybe though,&rdquo; she reflected, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re in the cellars....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We continued to jog on through the dusk.

    <h2>
      V
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the steeple!&rdquo; Réchamp burst out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the dimness I couldn&rsquo;t tell which way to look; but I suppose in
      the thickest midnight he would have known where he was. He jumped from the
      trap and took the old horse by the bridle. I made out that he was guiding
      us into a long village street edged by houses in which every light was
      extinguished. The snow on the ground sent up a pale reflection, and I
      began to see the gabled outline of the houses and the steeple at the head
      of the street. The place seemed as calm and unchanged as if the sound of
      war had never reached it. In the open space at the end of the village
      Réchamp checked the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The elm&mdash;there&rsquo;s the old elm in front of the church!&rdquo; he shouted in
      a voice like a boy&rsquo;s. He ran back and caught me by both hands. &ldquo;It was
      true, then&mdash;nothing&rsquo;s touched!&rdquo; The old woman asked: &ldquo;Is this
      Réchamp?&rdquo; and he went back to the horse&rsquo;s head and turned the trap toward
      a tall gate between park walls. The gate was barred and padlocked, and not
      a gleam showed through the shutters of the porter&rsquo;s lodge; but Réchamp,
      after listening a minute or two, gave a low call twice repeated, and
      presently the lodge door opened, and an old man peered out. Well&mdash;I
      leave you to brush in the rest. Old family servant, tears and hugs and so
      on. I know you affect to scorn the cinema, and this was it, tremolo and
      all. Hang it! This war&rsquo;s going to teach us not to be afraid of the
      obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      We piled into the trap and drove down a long avenue to the house. Black as
      the grave, of course; but in another minute the door opened, and there, in
      the hall, was another servant, screening a light&mdash;and then more doors
      opened on another cinema-scene: fine old drawing-room with family
      portraits, shaded lamp, domestic group about the fire. They evidently
      thought it was the servant coming to announce dinner, and not a head
      turned at our approach. I could see them all over Jean&rsquo;s shoulder: a
      grey-haired lady knitting with stiff fingers, an old gentleman with a high
      nose and a weak chin sitting in a big carved armchair and looking more
      like a portrait than the portraits; a pretty girl at his feet, with a
      dog&rsquo;s head in her lap, and another girl, who had a Red Cross on her
      sleeve, at the table with a book. She had been reading aloud in a rich
      veiled voice, and broke off her last phrase to say: &ldquo;Dinner....&rdquo; Then she
      looked up and saw Jean. Her dark face remained perfectly calm, but she
      lifted her hand in a just perceptible gesture of warning, and instantly
      understanding he drew back and pushed the servant forward in his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame la Comtesse&mdash;it is some one outside asking for Mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dark girl jumped up and ran out into the hall. I remember wondering:
      &ldquo;Is it because she wants to have him to herself first&mdash;or because
      she&rsquo;s afraid of their being startled?&rdquo; I wished myself out of the way, but
      she took no notice of me, and going straight to Jean flung her arms about
      him. I was behind him and could see her hands about his neck, and her
      brown fingers tightly locked. There wasn&rsquo;t much doubt about those two....
    </p>
    <p>
      The next minute she caught sight of me, and I was being rapidly tested by
      a pair of the finest eyes I ever saw&mdash;I don&rsquo;t apply the term to their
      setting, though that was fine too, but to the look itself, a look at once
      warm and resolute, all-promising and all-penetrating. I really can&rsquo;t do
      with fewer adjectives....
    </p>
    <p>
      Réchamp explained me, and she was full of thanks and welcome; not
      excessive, but&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;eloquent! She gave every
      intonation all it could carry, and without the least emphasis: that&rsquo;s the
      wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went back to &ldquo;prepare&rdquo; the parents, as they say in melodrama; and in a
      minute or two we followed. What struck me first was that these
      insignificant and inadequate people had the command of the grand gesture&mdash;had
      <i>la ligne</i>. The mother had laid aside her knitting&mdash;<i>not</i>
      dropped it&mdash;and stood waiting with open arms. But even in clasping
      her son she seemed to include me in her welcome. I don&rsquo;t know how to
      describe it; but they never let me feel I was in the way. I suppose that&rsquo;s
      part of what you call distinction; knowing instinctively how to deal with
      unusual moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the while, I was looking about me at the fine secure old room, in
      which nothing seemed altered or disturbed, the portraits smiling from the
      walls, the servants beaming in the doorway&mdash;and wondering how such
      things could have survived in the trail of death and havoc we had been
      following.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same thought had evidently struck Jean, for he dropped his sister&rsquo;s
      hand and turned to gaze about him too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then nothing&rsquo;s touched&mdash;nothing? I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Réchamp raised himself majestically from his chair, crossed
      the room and lifted Yvonne Malo&rsquo;s hand to his lips. &ldquo;Nothing is touched&mdash;thanks
      to this hand and this brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Réchamp was shining on her son through tears. &ldquo;Ah, yes&mdash;we
      owe it all to Yvonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All, all! Grandmamma will tell you!&rdquo; Simone chimed in; and Yvonne,
      brushing aside their praise with a half-impatient laugh, said to her
      betrothed: &ldquo;But your grandmother! You must go up to her at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A wonderful specimen, that grandmother: I was taken to see her after
      dinner. She sat by the fire in a bare panelled bedroom, bolt upright in an
      armchair with ears, a knitting-table at her elbow with a shaded candle on
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was even more withered and ancient than she looked in her photograph,
      and I judge she&rsquo;d never been pretty; but she somehow made me feel as if
      I&rsquo;d got through with prettiness. I don&rsquo;t know exactly what she reminded me
      of: a dried bouquet, or something rich and clovy that had turned brittle
      through long keeping in a sandal-wood box. I suppose her sandal-wood box
      had been Good Society. Well, I had a rare evening with her. Jean and his
      parents were called down to see the curé, who had hurried over to the
      château when he heard of the young man&rsquo;s arrival; and the old lady asked
      me to stay on and chat with her. She related their experiences with
      uncanny detachment, seeming chiefly to resent the indignity of having been
      made to descend into the cellar&mdash;&ldquo;to avoid French shells, if you&rsquo;ll
      believe it: the Germans had the decency not to bombard us,&rdquo; she observed
      impartially. I was so struck by the absence of rancour in her tone that
      finally, out of sheer curiosity, I made an allusion to the horror of
      having the enemy under one&rsquo;s roof. &ldquo;Oh, I might almost say I didn&rsquo;t see
      them,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;I never go downstairs any longer; and they didn&rsquo;t do
      me the honour of coming beyond my door. A glance sufficed them&mdash;an
      old woman like me!&rdquo; she added with a phosphorescent gleam of coquetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they searched the château, surely?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, a mere form; they were very
      decent&mdash;very decent,&rdquo; she almost snapped at me. &ldquo;There was a first
      moment, of course, when we feared it might be hard to get Monsieur de
      Réchamp away with my young grandson; but Mlle. Malo managed that very
      cleverly. They slipped off while the officers were dining.&rdquo; She looked at
      me with the smile of some arch old lady in a Louis XV pastel. &ldquo;My grandson
      Jean&rsquo;s fiancée is a very clever young woman: in my time no young girl
      would have been so sure of herself, so cool and quick. After all, there is
      something to be said for the new way of bringing up girls. My poor
      daughter-in-law, at Yvonne&rsquo;s age, was a bleating baby: she is so still, at
      times. The convent doesn&rsquo;t develop character. I&rsquo;m glad Yvonne was not
      brought up in a convent.&rdquo; And this champion of tradition smiled on me more
      intensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little I got from her the story of the German approach: the
      distracted fugitives pouring in from the villages north of Réchamp, the
      sound of distant cannonading, and suddenly, the next afternoon, after a
      reassuring lull, the sight of a single spiked helmet at the end of the
      drive. In a few minutes a dozen followed: mostly officers; then all at
      once the place hummed with them. There were supply waggons and motors in
      the court, bundles of hay, stacks of rifles, artillery-men unharnessing
      and rubbing down their horses. The crowd was hot and thirsty, and in a
      moment the old lady, to her amazement, saw wine and cider being handed
      about by the Réchamp servants. &ldquo;Or so at least I was told,&rdquo; she added,
      correcting herself, &ldquo;for it&rsquo;s not my habit to look out of the window. I
      simply sat here and waited.&rdquo; Her seat, as she spoke, might have been a
      curule chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Downstairs, it appeared, Mlle. Malo had instantly taken her measures. <i>She</i>
      didn&rsquo;t sit and wait. Surprised in the garden with Simone, she had made the
      girl walk quietly back to the house and receive the officers with her on
      the doorstep. The officer in command&mdash;captain, or whatever he was&mdash;had
      arrived in a bad temper, cursing and swearing, and growling out menaces
      about spies. The day was intensely hot, and possibly he had had too much
      wine. At any rate Mlle. Malo had known how to &ldquo;put him in his place&rdquo;; and
      when he and the other officers entered they found the dining-table set out
      with refreshing drinks and cigars, melons, strawberries and iced coffee.
      &ldquo;The clever creature! She even remembered that they liked whipped cream
      with their coffee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effect had been miraculous. The captain&mdash;what was his name? Yes,
      Chariot, Chariot&mdash;Captain Chariot had been specially complimentary on
      the subject of the whipped cream and the cigars. Then he asked to see the
      other members of the family, and Mlle. Malo told him there were only two&mdash;two
      old women! “He made a face at that, and said all the same he
should like to meet them; and she answered: ‘One is your hostess, the
Comtesse de Réchamp, who is ill in bed’&mdash;for my poor daughter-in-law was lying in
      bed paralyzed with rheumatism&mdash;‘and the other her
mother-in-law, a very old lady who never leaves her room.’”
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t there any men in the family?&rdquo; he had then asked; and she had
      said: &ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;two. The Comte de Réchamp and his son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In England. Monsieur de Réchamp went a month ago to take his son on a
      trip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer said: &ldquo;I was told they were here to-day&rdquo;; and Mlle. Malo
      replied: &ldquo;You had better have the house searched and satisfy yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed and said: &ldquo;The idea <i>had</i> occurred to me.&rdquo; She laughed
      also, and sitting down at the piano struck a few chords. Captain Chariot,
      who had his foot on the threshold, turned back&mdash;Simone had described
      the scene to her grandmother afterward. &ldquo;Some of the brutes, it seems, are
      musical,&rdquo; the old lady explained; &ldquo;and this was one of them. While he was
      listening, some soldiers appeared in the court carrying another who seemed
      to be wounded. It turned out afterward that he&rsquo;d been climbing a garden
      wall after fruit, and cut himself on the broken glass at the top; but the
      blood was enough&mdash;they raised the usual dreadful outcry about an
      ambush, and a lieutenant clattered into the room where Mlle. Malo sat
      playing Stravinsky.&rdquo; The old lady paused for her effect, and I was
      conscious of giving her all she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you believe it? It seems she looked at her watch-bracelet and said:
      &lsquo;Do you gentlemen dress for dinner? <i>I</i> do&mdash;but we&rsquo;ve still time
      for a little Moussorgsky&rsquo;&mdash;or whatever wild names they call
      themselves&mdash;&lsquo;if you&rsquo;ll make those people outside hold their tongues.&rsquo; 
      Our captain looked at her again, laughed, gave an order that sent the
      lieutenant right about, and sat down beside her at the piano. Imagine my
      stupour, dear sir: the drawing-room is directly under this room, and in a
      moment I heard two voices coming up to me. Well, I won&rsquo;t conceal from you
      that his was the finest. But then I always adored a barytone.&rdquo; She folded
      her shrivelled hands among their laces. &ldquo;After that, the Germans were <i>très
      bien&mdash;très bien</i>. They stayed two days, and there was nothing to
      complain of. Indeed, when the second detachment came, a week later, they
      never even entered the gates. Orders had been left that they should be
      quartered elsewhere. Of course we were lucky in happening on a man of the
      world like Captain Chariot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very lucky. It&rsquo;s odd, though, his having a French name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very. It probably accounts for his breeding,&rdquo; she answered placidly; and
      left me marvelling at the happy remoteness of old age.

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning early Jean de Réchamp came to my room. I was struck at
      once by the change in him: he had lost his first glow, and seemed nervous
      and hesitating. I knew what he had come for: to ask me to postpone our
      departure for another twenty-four hours. By rights we should have been off
      that morning; but there had been a sharp brush a few kilometres away, and
      a couple of poor devils had been brought to the château whom it would have
      been death to carry farther that day and criminal not to hurry to a base
      hospital the next morning. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve simply <i>got</i> to stay till
      to-morrow: you&rsquo;re in luck,&rdquo; I said laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed back, but with a frown that made me feel I had been a brute to
      speak in that way of a respite due to such a cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men will pull through, you know&mdash;trust Mlle. Malo for that!&rdquo; I
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His frown did not lift. He went to the window and drummed on the pane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see that breach in the wall, down there behind the trees? It&rsquo;s the
      only scratch the place has got. And think of Lennont! It&rsquo;s incredible&mdash;simply
      incredible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s like that everywhere, isn&rsquo;t it? Everything depends on the
      officer in command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: that&rsquo;s it, I suppose. I haven&rsquo;t had time to get a consecutive
      account of what happened: they&rsquo;re all too excited. Mlle. Malo is the only
      person who can tell me exactly how things went.&rdquo; He swung about on me.
      &ldquo;Look here, it sounds absurd, what I&rsquo;m asking; but try to get me an hour
      alone with her, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stared at the request, and he went on, still half-laughing: &ldquo;You see,
      they all hang on me; my father and mother, Simone, the curé, the servants.
      The whole village is coming up presently: they want to stuff their eyes
      full of me. It&rsquo;s natural enough, after living here all these long months
      cut off from everything. But the result is I haven&rsquo;t said two words to her
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you shall,&rdquo; I declared; and with an easier smile he turned to hurry
      down to a mass of thanksgiving which the curé was to celebrate in the
      private chapel. &ldquo;My parents wanted it,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;and after that the
      whole village will be upon us. But later&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Later I&rsquo;ll effect a diversion; I swear I will,&rdquo; I assured him.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      By daylight, decidedly, Mlle. Malo was less handsome than in the evening.
      It was my first thought as she came toward me, that afternoon, under the
      limes. Jean was still indoors, with his people, receiving the village; I
      rather wondered she hadn&rsquo;t stayed there with him. Theoretically, her place
      was at his side; but I knew she was a young woman who didn&rsquo;t live by rule,
      and she had already struck me as having a distaste for superfluous
      expenditures of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she was less effective by day. She looked older for one thing; her
      face was pinched, and a little sallow and for the first time I noticed
      that her cheek-bones were too high. Her eyes, too, had lost their velvet
      depth: fine eyes still, but not unfathomable. But the smile with which she
      greeted me was charming: it ran over her tired face like a lamp-lighter
      kindling flames as he runs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was looking for you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Shall we have a little talk? The
      reception is sure to last another hour: every one of the villagers is
      going to tell just what happened to him or her when the Germans came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve run away from the ceremony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a trifle tired of hearing the same adventures retold,&rdquo; she said,
      still smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought there <i>were</i> no adventures&mdash;that that was the
      wonder of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged. &ldquo;It makes their stories a little dull, at any rate; we&rsquo;ve
      not a hero or a martyr to show.&rdquo; She had strolled farther from the house
      as we talked, leading me in the direction of a bare horse-chestnut walk
      that led toward the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course Jean&rsquo;s got to listen to it all, poor boy; but I needn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she
      explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t know exactly what to answer and we walked on a little way in
      silence; then she said: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d carried him off this morning he would
      have escaped all this fuss.&rdquo; After a pause she added slowly: &ldquo;On the
      whole, it might have been as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To carry him off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She stopped and looked at me. &ldquo;I wish you <i>would</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would?&mdash;Now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, now: as soon as you can. He&rsquo;s really not strong yet&mdash;he&rsquo;s drawn
      and nervous.&rdquo; (&ldquo;So are you,&rdquo; I thought.) &ldquo;And the excitement is greater
      than you can perhaps imagine&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave her back her look. &ldquo;Why, I think I <i>can</i> imagine....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She coloured up through her sallow skin and then laughed away her blush.
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean the excitement of seeing <i>me!</i> But his parents, his
      grandmother, the curé, all the old associations&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I considered for a moment; then I said: &ldquo;As a matter of fact, you&rsquo;re about
      the only person he <i>hasn&rsquo;t</i> seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She checked a quick answer on her lips, and for a moment or two we faced
      each other silently. A sudden sense of intimacy, of complicity almost,
      came over me. What was it that the girl&rsquo;s silence was crying out to me?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I take him away now he won&rsquo;t have seen you at all,&rdquo; I continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood under the bare trees, keeping her eyes on me. &ldquo;Then take him
      away now!&rdquo; she retorted; and as she spoke I saw her face change, decompose
      into deadly apprehension and as quickly regain its usual calm. From where
      she stood she faced the courtyard, and glancing in the same direction I
      saw the throng of villagers coming out of the château. &ldquo;Take him away&mdash;take
      him away at once!&rdquo; she passionately commanded; and the next minute Jean de
      Réchamp detached himself from the group and began to limp down the walk in
      our direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was I to do? I can&rsquo;t exaggerate the sense of urgency Mlle. Malo&rsquo;s
      appeal gave me, or my faith in her sincerity. No one who had seen her
      meeting with Réchamp the night before could have doubted her feeling for
      him: if she wanted him away it was not because she did not delight in his
      presence. Even now, as he approached, I saw her face veiled by a faint
      mist of emotion: it was like watching a fruit ripen under a midsummer sun.
      But she turned sharply from the house and began to walk on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you give me a hint of your reason?&rdquo; I suggested as I followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My reason? I&rsquo;ve given it!&rdquo; I suppose I looked incredulous, for she added
      in a lower voice: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to hear&mdash;yet&mdash;about all the
      horrors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horrors? I thought there had been none here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All around us&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice became a whisper. &ldquo;Our friends... our
      neighbours... every one....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can hardly avoid hearing of that, can he? And besides, since you&rsquo;re
      all safe and happy.... Look here,&rdquo; I broke off, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s coming after us.
      Don&rsquo;t we look as if we were running away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned around, suddenly paler; and in a stride or two Réchamp was at
      our side. He was pale too; and before I could find a pretext for slipping
      away he had begun to speak. But I saw at once that he didn&rsquo;t know or care
      if I was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the name of the officer in command who was quartered here?&rdquo; he
      asked, looking straight at the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eye-brows slightly. &ldquo;Do you mean to say that after
      listening for three hours to every inhabitant of Béchamp you haven&rsquo;t found
      that out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They all call him something different. My grandmother says he had a
      French name: she calls him Chariot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your grandmother was never taught German: his name was the Oberst von
      Scharlach.&rdquo; She did not remember my presence either: the two were still
      looking straight in each other&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Béchamp had grown white to the lips: he was rigid with the effort to
      control himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me it was Scharlach who was here?&rdquo; he brought out at
      last in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her eyes in my direction. &ldquo;I was just explaining to Mr. Greer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Mr. Greer?&rdquo; He looked at me too, half-angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the stories that are about,&rdquo; she continued quietly; &ldquo;and I was
      saying to your friend that, since we had been so happy as to be spared, it
      seemed useless to dwell on what has happened elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn what happened elsewhere! I don&rsquo;t yet know what happened here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I put a hand on his arm. Mlle. Malo was looking hard at me, but I wouldn&rsquo;t
      let her see I knew it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to leave you to hear the whole story
      now,&rdquo; I said to Réchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t any story for him to hear!&rdquo; she broke in. She pointed at
      the serene front of the château, looking out across its gardens to the
      unscarred fields. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re safe; the place is untouched. Why brood on other
      horrors&mdash;horrors we were powerless to help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Réchamp held his ground doggedly. &ldquo;But the man&rsquo;s name is a curse and an
      abomination. Wherever he went he spread ruin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they say. Mayn&rsquo;t there be a mistake? Legends grow up so quickly in
      these dreadful times. Here&mdash;&rdquo; she looked about her again at the
      peaceful scene&mdash;&ldquo;here he behaved as you see. For heaven&rsquo;s sake be
      content with that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Content?&rdquo; He passed his hand across his forehead. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m blind with
      joy...or should be, if only...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me entreatingly, almost desperately, and I took hold of
      Réchamp&rsquo;s arm with a warning pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, don&rsquo;t you see that Mlle. Malo has been under a great
      strain? <i>La joie fait peur</i>&mdash;that&rsquo;s the trouble with both of
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lowered his head. &ldquo;Yes, I suppose it is.&rdquo; He took her hand And kissed
      it. &ldquo;I beg your pardon. Greer&rsquo;s right: we&rsquo;re both on edge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: I&rsquo;ll leave you for a little while, if you and Mr Greer will excuse
      me.&rdquo; She included us both in a quiet look that seemed to me extremely
      noble, and walked slowly away toward the château. Réchamp stood gazing
      after her for a moment; then he dropped down on one of benches at the edge
      of the path. He covered his face with his hands. &ldquo;Scharlach&mdash;Scharlach!&rdquo;
       I heard him say.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat there side by side for ten minutes or more without speaking.
      Finally I said: &ldquo;Look here, Réchamp&mdash;she&rsquo;s right and you&rsquo;re wrong. I
      shall be sorry I brought you here if you don&rsquo;t see it before it&rsquo;s too
      late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face was still hidden; but presently he dropped his hands and answered
      me. &ldquo;I do see. She&rsquo;s saved everything for me&mdash;my, people and my
      house, and the ground we&rsquo;re standing on. And I worship it because she
      walks on it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so do your people: the war&rsquo;s done that for you, anyhow,&rdquo; I reminded
      him.

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The morning after we were off before dawn. Our time allowance was up, and
      it was thought advisable, on account of our wounded, to slip across the
      exposed bit of road in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mlle. Malo was downstairs when we started, pale in her white dress, but
      calm and active. We had borrowed a farmer&rsquo;s cart in which our two men
      could be laid on a mattress, and she had stocked our trap with food and
      remedies. Nothing seemed to have been forgotten. While I was settling the
      men I suppose Réchamp turned back into the hall to bid her good-bye;
      anyhow, when she followed him out a moment later he looked quieter and
      less strained. He had taken leave of his parents and his sister upstairs,
      and Yvonne Malo stood alone in the dark driveway, watching us as we drove
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not much talk between us during our slow drive back to the
      lines. We had to go it a snail&rsquo;s pace, for the roads were rough; and there
      was time for meditation. I knew well enough what my companion was thinking
      about and my own thoughts ran on the same lines. Though the story of the
      German occupation of Réchamp had been retold to us a dozen times the main
      facts did not vary. There were little discrepancies of detail, and gaps in
      the narrative here and there; but all the household, from the astute
      ancestress to the last bewildered pantry-boy, were at one in saying that
      Mlle. Malo&rsquo;s coolness and courage had saved the chateau and the village.
      The officer in command had arrived full of threats and insolence: Mlle.
      Malo had placated and disarmed him, turned his suspicions to ridicule,
      entertained him and his comrades at dinner, and contrived during that time&mdash;or
      rather while they were making music afterward (which they did for half the
      night, it seemed)&mdash;that Monsieur de Réchamp and Alain should slip out
      of the cellar in which they had been hidden, gain the end of the gardens
      through an old hidden passage, and get off in the darkness. Meanwhile
      Simone had been safe upstairs with her mother and grandmother, and none of
      the officers lodged in the château had&mdash;after a first hasty
      inspection&mdash;set foot in any part of the house but the wing assigned
      to them. On the third morning they had left, and Scharlach, before going,
      had put in Mlle. Malo&rsquo;s hands a letter requesting whatever officer should
      follow him to show every consideration to the family of the Comte de
      Réchamp, and if possible&mdash;owing to the grave illness of the Countess&mdash;avoid
      taking up quarters in the château: a request which had been scrupulously
      observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the amazing but undisputed facts over which Réchamp and I, in
      our different ways, were now pondering. He hardly spoke, and when he did
      it was only to make some casual reference to the road or to our wounded
      soldiers; but all the while I sat at his side I kept hearing the echo of
      the question he was inwardly asking himself, and hoping to God he wouldn&rsquo;t
      put it to me....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly noon when we finally reached the lines, and the men had to
      have a rest before we could start again; but a couple of hours later we
      landed them safely at the base hospital. From there we had intended to go
      back to Paris; but as we were starting there came an unexpected summons to
      another point of the front, where there had been a successful
      night-attack, and a lot of Germans taken in a blown-up trench. The place
      was fifty miles away, and off my beat, but the number of wounded on both
      sides was exceptionally heavy, and all the available ambulances had
      already started. An urgent call had come for more, and there was nothing
      for it but to go; so we went.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found things in a bad mess at the second line shanty-hospital where
      they were dumping the wounded as fast as they could bring them in. At
      first we were told that none were fit to be carried farther that night;
      and after we had done what we could we went off to hunt up a shake-down in
      the village. But a few minutes later an orderly overtook us with a message
      from the surgeon. There was a German with an abdominal wound who was in a
      bad way, but might be saved by an operation if he could be got back to the
      base before midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would we take him at once and then come back for others?
    </p>
    <p>
      There is only one answer to such requests, and a few minutes later we were
      back at the hospital, and the wounded man was being carried out on a
      stretcher. In the shaky lantern gleam I caught a glimpse of a livid face
      and a torn uniform, and saw that he was an officer, and nearly done for.
      Réchamp had climbed to the box, and seemed not to be noticing what was
      going on at the back of the motor. I understood that he loathed the job,
      and wanted not to see the face of the man we were carrying; so when we had
      got him settled I jumped into the ambulance beside him and called out to
      Béchamp that we were ready. A second later an <i>infirmier</i> ran up with
      a little packet and pushed it into my hand. &ldquo;His papers,&rdquo; he explained. I
      pocketed them and pulled the door shut, and we were off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man lay motionless on his back, conscious, but desperately weak. Once
      I turned my pocket-lamp on him and saw that he was young&mdash;about
      thirty&mdash;with damp dark hair and a thin face. He had received a
      flesh-wound above the eyes, and his forehead was bandaged, but the rest of
      the face uncovered. As the light fell on him he lifted his eyelids and
      looked at me: his look was inscrutable.
    </p>
    <p>
      For half an hour or so I sat there in the dark, the sense of that face
      pressing close on me. It was a damnable face&mdash;meanly handsome, basely
      proud. In my one glimpse of it I had seen that the man was suffering
      atrociously, but as we slid along through the night he made no sound. At
      length the motor stopped with a violent jerk that drew a single moan from
      him. I turned the light on him, but he lay perfectly still, lips and lids
      shut, making no sign; and I jumped out and ran round to the front to see
      what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The motor had stopped for lack of gasolene and was stock still in the deep
      mud. Réchamp muttered something about a leak in his tank. As he bent over
      it, the lantern flame struck up into his face, which was set and
      businesslike. It struck me vaguely that he showed no particular surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can tinker it up; but we&rsquo;ve got to have more essence to go on
      with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stared at him in despair: it was a good hour&rsquo;s walk back to the lines,
      and we weren&rsquo;t so sure of getting any gasolene when we got there! But
      there was no help for it; and as Réchamp was dead lame, no alternative but
      for me to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      I opened the ambulance door, gave another look at the motionless man
      inside and took out a remedy which I handed over to Réchamp with a word of
      explanation. &ldquo;You know how to give a hypo? Keep a close eye on him and pop
      this in if you see a change&mdash;not otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;Do you suppose he&rsquo;ll die?&rdquo; he asked below his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. If we get him to the hospital before morning I think he&rsquo;ll
      pull through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right.&rdquo; He unhooked one of the motor lanterns and handed it over
      to me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best,&rdquo; he said as I turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting back to the lines through that pitch-black forest, and finding
      somebody to bring the gasolene back for me was about the weariest job I
      ever tackled. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine why it wasn&rsquo;t daylight when we finally
      got to the place where I had left the motor. It seemed to me as if I had
      been gone twelve hours when I finally caught sight of the grey bulk of the
      car through the thinning darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Réchamp came forward to meet us, and took hold of my arm as I was opening
      the door of the car. &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had lifted up my pocket-lamp, and its light fell on Réchamp&rsquo;s face,
      which was perfectly composed, and seemed less gaunt and drawn than at any
      time since we had started on our trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead? Why&mdash;how? What happened? Did you give him the hypodermic?&rdquo; I
      stammered, taken aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No time to. He died in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know he did? Were you with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I was with him,&rdquo; Réchamp retorted, with a sudden harshness
      which made me aware that I had grown harsh myself. But I had been almost
      sure the man wasn&rsquo;t anywhere near death when I left him. I opened the door
      of the ambulance and climbed in with my lantern. He didn&rsquo;t appear to have
      moved, but he was dead sure enough&mdash;had been for two or three hours,
      by the feel of him. It must have happened not long after I left.... Well,
      I&rsquo;m not a doctor, anyhow....
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t think Réchamp and I exchanged a word during the rest of that run.
      But it was my fault and not his if we didn&rsquo;t. By the mere rub of his
      sleeve against mine as we sat side by side on the motor I knew he was
      conscious of no bar between us: he had somehow got back, in the night&rsquo;s
      interval, to a state of wholesome stolidity, while I, on the contrary, was
      tingling all over with exposed nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was glad enough when we got back to the base at last, and the grim load
      we carried was lifted out and taken into the hospital. Réchamp waited in
      the courtyard beside his car, lighting a cigarette in the cold early
      sunlight; but I followed the bearers and the surgeon into the whitewashed
      room where the dead man was laid out to be undressed. I had a burning spot
      at the pit of my stomach while his clothes were ripped off him and the
      bandages undone: I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes from the surgeon&rsquo;s face. But the
      surgeon, with a big batch of wounded on his hands, was probably thinking
      more of the living than the dead; and besides, we were near the front, and
      the body before him was an enemy&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      He finished his examination and scribbled something in a note-book. &ldquo;Death
      must have taken place nearly five hours ago,&rdquo; he merely remarked: it was
      the conclusion I had already come to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how about the papers?&rdquo; the surgeon continued. &ldquo;You have them, I
      suppose? This way, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We left the half-stripped body on the blood-stained oil-cloth, and he led
      me into an office where a functionary sat behind a littered desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The papers? Thank you. You haven&rsquo;t examined them? Let us see, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I handed over the leather note-case I had thrust into my pocket the
      evening before, and saw for the first time its silver-edged corners and
      the coronet in one of them. The official took out the papers and spread
      them on the desk between us. I watched him absently while he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he uttered an exclamation. &ldquo;Ah&mdash;that&rsquo;s a haul!&rdquo; he said, and
      pushed a bit of paper toward me. On it was engraved the name: Oberst Graf
      Benno von Scharlach....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good riddance,&rdquo; said the surgeon over my shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went back to the courtyard and saw Réchamp still smoking his cigarette
      in the cold sunlight. I don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;d been in the hospital ten
      minutes; but I felt as old as Methuselah.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend greeted me with a smile. &ldquo;Ready for breakfast?&rdquo; he said, and a
      little chill ran down my spine.... But I said: &ldquo;Oh, all right&mdash;come
      along....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For, after all, I <i>knew</i> there wasn&rsquo;t a paper of any sort on that man
      when he was lifted into my ambulance the night before: the French
      officials attend to their business too carefully for me not to have been
      sure of that. And there wasn&rsquo;t the least shred of evidence to prove that
      he hadn&rsquo;t died of his wounds during the unlucky delay in the forest; or
      that Réchamp had known his tank was leaking when we started out from the
      lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could do with a <i>café complet</i>, couldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Réchamp suggested,
      looking straight at me with his good blue eyes; and arm in arm we started
      off to hunt for the inn....
